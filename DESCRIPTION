Description: A framework which provides users a set of useful primitive elements for
  specifying individual based simulation models, with special attention models for
  infectious disease epidemiology. Users build models by specifying variables for
  each characteristic of individuals in the simulated population by using data
  structures exposed by the package. The package provides efficient methods for
  finding subsets of individuals based on these variables, or cohorts. Cohorts can
  then be targeted for variable updates or scheduled for events. Variable updates
  queued during a time step are executed at the end of a discrete time step, and
  the code places no restrictions on how individuals are allowed to interact.
  These data structures are designed to provide an intuitive way for users to turn
  their conceptual model of a system into executable code, which is fast and
  memory efficient.
